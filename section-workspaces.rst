Workspaces and Window Management
================================

All dialog boxes, waveform groups, and other GUI elements in ngscopeclient may be used docked or free-floating as
needed.

To dock a window, drag the title bar (if floating) or tab title (if docked) to the desired location
(:numref:`w-docking`).

To create more complex windowing layouts, you may find it helpful to create *workspaces*.

A workspace is a window which has no function of its own, and simply serves as a container for docking other windows
into. The workspace can itself be docked into another workspace or the main application window, allowing creation of
complex multi-window or multi-tab layouts to suit your experimental needs (:numref:`w-workspace`, :numref:`w-workspace2`,
:numref:`w-workspace3`).

In the default ngscopeclient window layout, for example, the "Filter Graph" tab is a workspace which contains both the
filter graph editor and the filter palette.

To rename a workspace, right click on the window title (if floating) or tab title (if docked) and enter the desired
name.
